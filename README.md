Billy G. Smith, "Almshouse Admissions Philadelhia 1796-1803" (March 4, 2020), distributed by University of Pennsylvania McNeil Center for Early American Studies, https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/42/. Smith created this sample from a microfilm of the Index of Admissions to the Philadelphia Almshouse housed in the Philadelphia City Archives. This sample, taken from the years 1796-1803, includes last names beginning with A through G, as well as a small number of "black" and "mulatto" individuals without last names.

In contrast to Gary B. Nash, I have chosen not to include inmates described as "mulatto" under the term "black," unless the description reads "black or mulatto," in which case I did include them under "black." The grouping of black and mulatto inmates does not alter the conclusions I have drawn.
