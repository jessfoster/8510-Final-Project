Admitted Abigail Penrose a Young Woman of nonresidence, but being under the influence of a dose of Opium, with a view to destroy herself is sent here. This is the third (and it has proved the most effectual attempt) time that she has endeavored to put end to her life. She lived with Thomas Moore, Sadler, the Northeast Corner of Front and Market Streets. The reason of this unhappy Young woman laying such violence on herself could not be ascertained.
