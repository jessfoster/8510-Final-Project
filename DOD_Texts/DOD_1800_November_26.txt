November 26, 1800

Admitted Sarah Scadden Pregnant, she was born in this City, is two and twenty years of age, has swore the Child she now bears to Charles Lang (now confined in Jail on suspicion of debt before Ebenezer Ferguson, Esquire, and by whom he was committed to Prison), and [he] gave security that said Sarah & her Child should not become a charge to the Publick before his commitment, since which said Sarah says his security has given him up and she is sent here. Admitted Sarah Philips alias Haines, Wife of Philip Haines who came in the 24th instant (November). A worthless troublesome couple, she's as good at fence jumping as he is. What reason could this Woman have in telling the Guardian her name was Philips? There could be no other than to deceive, as he was the same who sent her Husband here, and her being of a notorious drunken character, thought that if she told her right name he would not have granted an Order for her admission, & is come in very sick as she says with the fever and Augue.
