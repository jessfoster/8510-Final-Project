Admitted Mary Wright hath Legal residence, is twenty years of age, born in this City. Her Husband Dominick Wright twelve months ago went to sea in the Ship Jane Brown to London (the Owner nor Captains Name she cannot tell) and heard only once from him since, and as she says, never received one farthing of his Monthly pay. (The reason is obvious, he neither gave Power of Attorney or Orders for her to receive any part thereof). However, unfortunate it is that she was taken with a Fit & contiguous to the fire place, she fell into the Flames and got burnt in a most distressing manner.
