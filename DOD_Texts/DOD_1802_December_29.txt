Admitted Ann Campbell Legal Resident 14 Months old. The Father of this Child, Andrew Campbell, No. 16 Cherry Alley, Shoemaker, after beating & abusing his Wife, turned her out of doors, which obliged her to hire at service as housemaid to Lawyer Erwin, and to procure an Order of Admission for her child, and brought it here, she not being able to support herself and Child, the Father having absconded.
