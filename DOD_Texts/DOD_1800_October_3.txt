Admitted Margaret Dillmore a Child between four and five years of age, her mother died in the fever of 1798, the Father Thomas Dillmore is a Seaman and hath deserted his Child ever since the death of his Wife, and the child has been taken care of ever since, till now, by its aunt, who is Wife to Robert Brown, and lives near the Playhouse in South Street. She says that said Dillmore sailed out of New York, but cannot tell in whose employ, and likewise that he has been in this very City lately, never came near his Child, neither could she learn or find out his hidden place. Margaret is a fine Child, and her aunt would still have taken care of it if her Husband had been in a way that would support it and his own family, and this not being the case She brought the child here.
