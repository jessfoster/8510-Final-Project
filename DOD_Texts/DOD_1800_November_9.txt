November 9, 1800

Birth Sarah Lackey was last night delivered of a Mulatto Child whom she calls Charlott Marborough (notwithstanding said Sarah swore before John Jennings, Esquire, that Isaac Hanson was Father of the Child she is now brought to bed with; see Occurences of the 18th September last. Thomas Marborough, the real Father of the Child, is the Black Man who eloped the 26th May, last, on account of having Criminal Contact with Rachael Ward, another pauper at that time in the House).
