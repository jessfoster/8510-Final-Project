Admitted Margery Olliver Legal Resident, born in Ireland, has resided in the City of Philadelphia many years, particularly in the family of Richard Bache, Esquire, with whose family she went to England and returned with them during which time, and for some time since she behaved herself in an Orderly manner; married a person by the name of Rees Olliver with whom she lived comfortably until his death, which was by the yellow fever in the year of 1798. She has one child, Elizabeth Olliver, who is provided for by the bounty of John Harwood, son in Law to Richard Bache. This poor woman has lived in the family of Peter Browne, Esquire, who did all in their power to restrain her from intemperate drinking, but to no purpose. She has such a propensity for drunkeness that they were obliged to part with her, and with their assistance she got to housekeeping; a short time since and from which to the present time she has been in a state of intoxication, that she is now deprived of her reason, and for fear she would commit some act of violence on herself, Abraham Garrigues and Peter Browne, Esquire, has interfered and sent her into this house.
