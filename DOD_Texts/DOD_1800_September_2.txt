Admitted Michael McDermit an Irish-man, born in the County of Donegal, and came to this City in 1793 and stayed but one night in it, then went to Lancaster County, and from that to York County, but it don't appear from his own account that he has gained in either of said places any Legal residence having only worked eight or ten weeks in one, three or four months in the other of them, his last place of residence was the latter of the above mentioned Counties from whence he came to the City on Sunday the 31st ultimate. This Man is but twenty seven years of age, and has been much afflicted with the fever and ague, [and] with a very sore back, all of which rendered him incapable of labouring for a livelihood.
