Admitted John Baptist (Black-man) Legal Resident about 60 years old a Native of Jamaica, came from there and landed in this City 6 years ago, four of which he lived in one place and paid fifteen pounds rent per annum, and followed Tayloring for his support. He's not sick but says times are dull, and don't get work, which obliged him to come here.
