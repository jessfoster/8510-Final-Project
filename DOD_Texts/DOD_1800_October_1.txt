Admitted William McDowell an Irish-man, landed at New Castle, Delaware State, and went into the Jerseys in a short time after his arrival, and worked at different Iron Works. Walker, Godfreys & Others, Iron Works in said State, working as, he says, seven or eight months at one of them, nine or ten months at another, and so on, that in the Whole, he has been employed between two and three years at those different places, but cannot tell neither the Counties or Townships that either of said Iron works are in. The last of the above places he worked at was Godfreys, and it is six months since he left it, and has been in this City ever since, and followed drayingâ€”of course he hath no legal residence here but if he has any it must be in Jersey where he has worked so long. However he has come in here in a Venereal condition, and full of pain in his limbs.
